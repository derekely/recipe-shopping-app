# Overview

This project is to create a software that has 2 major elements to it a shopping list and a recipe book. The user can store their own recipies using this app and quickly add ingredients into a shopping list.

This software was written to demonstrate basic understanding of different aspects of Angular in an Angular project.



# Development Environment
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Bootstrap, downloaded locally for this project -> npm install --save bootstrap@3

\
"Angular is an application-design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps." Meaning that when someone clicks on a link the page is not changed but the code itself is changed keeping the page the same, so no more loading screens! 
\
"Node.js is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's Event Machine and Python's Twisted. Node.js takes the event model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library." 
\
Bootstrap is a library you can add into your project to have easily made CSS code, instead of doing it yourself this library has pre built CSS methods to add to your code.
